# Bank Bonus Tracker - Optimized Version

A high-performance React application for tracking and managing bank bonus offers for two players. This optimized version includes significant performance improvements and is ready for GitHub Pages deployment.

## üöÄ Performance Optimizations

### Frontend Optimizations
- **Lazy Loading**: All pages are lazy-loaded to reduce initial bundle size
- **Code Splitting**: Manual chunk splitting for better caching
- **API Caching**: In-memory caching with 5-minute TTL
- **Memoization**: React.memo and useMemo for expensive calculations
- **Bundle Optimization**: Terser minification with console removal
- **Asset Optimization**: Optimized images and CSS

### Build Optimizations
- **Vite Configuration**: Optimized for production builds
- **Tree Shaking**: Automatic removal of unused code
- **Chunk Splitting**: Vendor chunks separated for better caching
- **Source Maps**: Disabled in production for smaller builds
- **CSS Optimization**: Code splitting and preprocessing
